# Crypto Arbitrage, Module 3 Challenge

This is a JupyterLab application in which a trader or a crypto currency company can upload two CSV files of their arbitrage trading history in order to anaylize the two files against one another. This analysis will provide data showing whether the trades were profitable or not and on which days. This analysis will also plot the data on line graphs, which will help the user visualise their upward or downward trend. The user will be able to determine whether their profitability has increase or decreased over time.

## Technologies

This application was written in Python 3.9.12. This application is dependent on the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/).

---

## Installation Guide

If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) downloaded, then pandas and JupyterLab will be part of your package. You can check that they're ready to use by typing the following in your CLI terminal:
```python
conda list pandas
conda list jupyterlab
```

---

## Usage

Open your CLI terminal and type
```python
jupyter lab
```
then JupyterLab will automatically open in your browswer. Use the left side menu bar to search for the `crypto_arbitrage.ipynb` file. Open this file. Add your personalized CSV files with the data you'd like to anaylze to either the same folder OR you should know what folder they're in on your local computer so that you'll be able to access them within the program. Then you can read your CSV files and use any of the provided code to anaylize the files in order to get the resulting information that you need.
