# Crypto Arbitrage, Module 3 Challenge

This is a JupyterLab application in which a trader or a crypto currency company can upload two CSV files of their arbitrage trading history in order to anaylize the two files against one another. This analysis will provide data showing whether the trades were profitable or not and on which days. This analysis will also plot the data on line graphs, which will help the user visualise their upward or downward trend. The user will be able to determine whether their profitability has increase or decreased over time.
